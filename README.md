# Utils monorepo

A monorepo with different packages that provide great utilities for common tasks. They're all written in TypeScript and Deno (using NodeJS-compatible TypeScript code) and published to `jsr.io`, currently under [the `@zakahacecosas` scope](https://jsr.io/@zakahacecosas).

## Packages

| Package | Description |
| `string-utils` | 50+ string related utility functions. Includes tools for CLI-targeted string formatting, validation, formatting, casing, etc... |
| `number-utils` | 15+ number related utility functions. _This package is newer and less complete, it'll grow over time._ |
