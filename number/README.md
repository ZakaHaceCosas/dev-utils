## Feature highlights

- The classics: `isOdd()`, `isEven()`, `isPositive()`, and `isNegative()`.
- Calculate how many possible combinations exists using combinatorial math.
- Less-seen checks, like `isPrime()`, `isPerfectSquare()`, or `isBetween()`.
- Greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two numbers.
- Sum and average of a `number[]`.
- Degrees to radians and vice versa.
- Feet to meters and vice versa.
- Kilometers per hour to miles per hour and vice versa.
- Even more!

## Documentation

The module is fully documented in `jsr.io`, [click here for module documentation](https://jsr.io/@zakahacecosas/number-utils/doc/).

All functions have rich JSDoc (examples included) anyway, so your editor itself works as your documentation.
