# `entity-utils`

A few functions for helping with arrays and objects. Works with NodeJS, Bun, Deno, and (if transpiled to JavaScript) with any web browser.

## Installation

```bash
# deno, yarn, or pnpm
deno add jsr:@zakahacecosas/entity-utils
yarn add jsr:@zakahacecosas/entity-utils
pnpm add jsr:@zakahacecosas/entity-utils
# npm or bun (the name here is different!)
npm install entities-utils
bun add entities-utils
# you can use npx/bunx jsr add... too, but it doesn't work with every nodejs project
# and the package name is different because someone holds an unmaintained "entity-utils"
```

## Feature highlights

- As of now just key-map and value-map, I'll add more stuff later on.

## Documentation

All functions have rich JSDoc (examples included), so the editor itself counts as "documentation".

The module is fully documented in `jsr.io`, [click here for module documentation](https://jsr.io/@zakahacecosas/entity-utils/doc/).
